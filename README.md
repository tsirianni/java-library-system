# Library System Challenge

This repo is the implementation of the library system challenge proposed on the Java path.
This implementation aims to go a bit beyond the required features, offering a reasonably wide array
of features compacted in an interactive CLI.

The CLI has the following options:

```
1 - Register a client
2 - List all Clients
3 - Register an author
4 - List all authors
5 - Register a book
6 - List all books
7 - Check out a book
8 - Return a book
9 - View check out history
```

Before exploring the implementation itself, take a moment to test the CLI by yourself.
